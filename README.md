# Employee-Tracker
A command-line application to manage a company's employee database

## Description
A command-line application that accepts user input. The application allows the user to view and manage the departments, roles, and employees in a company. It provides an easy way for business owners to track, edit and analyze information throughout the entire company. During the creation of the application I was able to learn and implement Node.js, Inquirer, and MySQL in a command line application.

## Installation

This is a command line application that runs in Node.js and is initiated by running the index.js from within the applications directory.

## Usage

Navigate via command line to the directory of the app, initiate by typing: node index. You can exit the program using "control c" to exit the index.

Refer to this walk through video to demonstrate the different functions of the application:

After typing node index, you will see the following title image, showing the program is running:
